# Discord  

Discord webhook system with GitHub Actions. 

## Using  

Right now the project is not complete and is still in prototype phases.  
This is a simple GitHub action that allows to send signals to Discord Webhooks when a GitHub Check Suite completes. This requires a few environment variables:
  * `WEBHOOK_URL` - The Webhook to send the info to.  

**WIP!!**
